2. **Create New Project** → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Select this repository**: `Rmgfr`
4. **Follow the step-by-step guide**: `RAILWAY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### Option 2: Use the Automated Script

```powershell
# Windows
cd platform
npm run deploy:railway

# Or manually
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File railway-deploy.ps1
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
cd platform
chmod +x railway-deploy.sh
./railway-deploy.sh
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Railway account with your token is ready
- [ ] GitHub repository is accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are prepared

### During Deployment:
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL database service
- [ ] Create Redis cache service (optional)
- [ ] Deploy API service with correct root directory: `platform/api`
- [ ] Deploy Web service with correct root directory: `platform/web`
- [ ] Set all required environment variables
- [ ] Run database setup script: `railway-db-setup.sql`

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test API health: `https://your-api-domain.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Test API docs: `https://your-api-domain.railway.app/docs`
- [ ] Test web app: `https://your-web-domain.railway.app`
- [ ] Run verification script: `npm run verify:deployment`

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### API Service Required Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/antifraud
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
ENVIRONMENT=production
API_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-web-domain.railway.app
TRUSTED_HOSTS=localhost,*.vercel.app,*.supabase.co,*.railway.app
```

### Web Service Required Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-clerk-key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your-clerk-secret
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

1. **Connect to your Railway PostgreSQL**:
   - Use Railway's database console
   - Or connect via external tool with connection string

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of railway-db-setup.sql
   ```

3. **Verify tables created**:
   - organizations, projects, events, decisions, cases, rules
   - Sample data inserted for testing

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Automated Testing:
```bash
cd platform
npm run verify:deployment
```

### Manual Testing:
1. **API Health**: `GET /health`
2. **API Root**: `GET /`
3. **API Docs**: `GET /docs`
4. **Web App**: Visit your web domain
5. **API Endpoints**: Test `/v1/events`, `/v1/decisions`, `/v1/cases`

## 📊 Expected Service URLs

After successful deployment, you'll get URLs like:
- **Web App**: `https://anti-fraud-platform-web-production.up.railway.app`
- **API**: `https://anti-fraud-platform-api-production.up.railway.app`
- **API Docs**: `https://anti-fraud-platform-api-production.up.railway.app/docs`
