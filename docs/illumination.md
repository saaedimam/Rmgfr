# Code Illumination Report
*The Code Whisperer's Deep Analysis*

## Executive Summary

This codebase tells a story of an anti-fraud platform built with care, but carrying the weight of rapid iteration. Like a well-worn path through a forest, the patterns are clear but some branches have grown wild. The architecture shows wisdom in separation of concerns, yet complexity has accumulated in the decision-making core.

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action (Web/Mobile)
    ↓
Next.js API Routes (/api/mobile/events, /api/events/test)
    ↓
FastAPI Backend (/v2/events, /v1/events)
    ↓
FraudEngine.evaluate_event() or FraudEngine.calculate_risk_score()
    ↓
DecisionGate.decide() (TypeScript + Python versions)
    ↓
Database Storage (Postgres via Supabase)
    ↓
Decision Response + Case Creation (if review)
```

### Key Data Contracts

**Event Flow:**
- Mobile → Web Proxy → FastAPI → Risk Engine → Decision Gate → Database
- Idempotency handled via `x-idempotency-key` headers
- Risk scoring happens in both TypeScript (client-side) and Python (server-side)

**Authentication:**
- Clerk for web authentication
- API keys for service-to-service communication
- Project-scoped access via `project_id`

## Complexity Hotspots (Top 10)

### 1. **FraudEngine.evaluate_event()** - `platform/api/src/services/fraud_engine.py:21-91`
**Complexity:** High - 70 lines, nested conditionals, multiple database queries
**Pain Points:**
- Deep nesting in rule evaluation loop (lines 62-76)
- Mixed concerns: data fetching + business logic + decision making
- Hard-coded risk score calculations
- Exception handling swallows specific errors

**Surgical Fix:** Extract pure decision logic, separate data access

### 2. **DecisionGate.decide()** - `platform/web/src/lib/decision-gate.ts:65-125`
**Complexity:** High - 60 lines, complex conditional logic
**Pain Points:**
- Duplicated logic between TypeScript and Python versions
- Magic numbers for risk bands (0.3, 0.6, 0.8)
- FPR threshold logic mixed with decision logic
**Surgical Fix:** Extract risk band calculation, unify with Python version

### 3. **create_event()** - `platform/api/src/routers/events_v2.py:67-198`
**Complexity:** High - 131 lines, multiple responsibilities
**Pain Points:**
- Event creation + risk calculation + decision making + database operations
- Hard-coded project ID
- Complex SQL string building
- Mixed async/sync patterns

**Surgical Fix:** Extract event processing pipeline, separate concerns

### 4. **FraudEngine.calculate_risk_score()** - `platform/api/src/services/fraud_engine_v2.py:60-131`
**Complexity:** Medium-High - 71 lines, multiple analysis methods
**Pain Points:**
- Weighted scoring with hard-coded weights
- Multiple async calls without proper error handling
- Complex risk factor aggregation

**Surgical Fix:** Extract individual analyzers, make weights configurable

### 5. **list_events()** - `platform/api/src/routers/events_v2.py:200-281`
**Complexity:** Medium - 81 lines, dynamic query building
**Pain Points:**
- Manual SQL query construction
- Parameter counting logic
- Mixed data transformation

**Surgical Fix:** Extract query builder, use ORM patterns

### 6. **DecisionGate._get_default_decision()** - `platform/web/src/lib/decision-gate.ts:127-146`
**Complexity:** Medium - 19 lines, nested object access
**Pain Points:**
- Hard-coded decision matrix
- Complex fallback logic
- Duplicated with Python version

**Surgical Fix:** Extract to shared configuration

### 7. **Rate Limit Rule Evaluation** - `platform/api/src/services/fraud_engine.py:110-149`
**Complexity:** Medium - 39 lines, complex query building
**Pain Points:**
- Duplicated query logic for different scopes
- Manual time window calculations
- Mixed business logic with data access

**Surgical Fix:** Extract query builder, separate scope logic

### 8. **Mobile Event Proxy** - `platform/web/app/api/mobile/events/route.ts:4-30`
**Complexity:** Low-Medium - 26 lines, simple but fragile
**Pain Points:**
- Hard-coded API endpoints
- Basic error handling
- No validation of mobile payload

**Surgical Fix:** Extract mobile API client, add validation

### 9. **Feature Flag Middleware** - `platform/api/flags_middleware.py:5-15`
**Complexity:** Low - 10 lines, but architectural concern
**Pain Points:**
- Hard-coded release channels
- No database integration
- Limited flexibility

**Surgical Fix:** Connect to database feature flags

### 10. **Environment Configuration** - `platform/web/lib/serverEnv.ts:6-54`
**Complexity:** Low-Medium - 48 lines, validation logic
**Pain Points:**
- Mixed legacy and new environment variables
- Complex validation schema
- No clear separation of concerns

**Surgical Fix:** Split into domain-specific configs

## Type Contract Mismatches

### Critical Issues:
1. **Duplicate DecisionGate Logic**: TypeScript and Python versions have diverged
2. **Missing OpenAPI Generation**: No automated type generation from FastAPI
3. **Inconsistent Event Models**: Different shapes between v1 and v2 APIs
4. **Mobile API Types**: Hand-written types not synced with backend

### Specific Mismatches:
- `Decision` interface in mobile has different fields than backend
- `EventCreate` models differ between v1 and v2 APIs
- Risk score calculation methods differ between frontend and backend

## Duplication Candidates

1. **Decision Gate Logic**: TypeScript + Python versions (95% similar)
2. **Event Models**: Multiple EventCreate/EventResponse definitions
3. **Risk Band Calculation**: Duplicated in multiple places
4. **Database Connection Logic**: Scattered across services
5. **Error Handling Patterns**: Inconsistent across routers

## Feature Flag Pain Points

1. **Hard-coded Release Channels**: No database integration
2. **Limited Scope**: Only UI flags, no business logic flags
3. **No A/B Testing**: Flags are binary, no gradual rollouts
4. **Manual Management**: No admin interface for flag updates

## Architectural Observations

### Strengths:
- Clear separation between web, API, and mobile
- Good use of TypeScript strict mode
- Proper async/await patterns
- Database abstraction layer exists
- Comprehensive error handling in most places

### Areas for Growth:
- Business logic mixed with data access
- Duplicated decision-making logic
- Manual type maintenance
- Limited test coverage for complex functions
- Hard-coded business rules

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Priority 1**: Extract pure decision logic - this will unlock testing and reduce complexity
2. **Generate OpenAPI types**: This will eliminate type drift and improve developer experience
3. **Extract event pipeline**: This will make the system more testable and maintainable
4. **Consolidate risk calculation**: This will reduce duplication and make thresholds configurable

The codebase shows the wisdom of experienced developers who built incrementally. Now it's time to gently refactor, preserving the good while elevating the complex into clear, testable patterns.
